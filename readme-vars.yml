  You have to create a Spotify application through their [developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) to get your Client ID and secret. Set the Redirect URI to match your APP_URL address with `/api/oauth/spotify/callback` included after the domain (i.e., `http://localhost/api/oauth/spotify/callback`).

  The application requires an external [mongodb database](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/), supported versions are 4.x, 5.x, and 6.x.

  This ia an all-in-one container which includes both the server and client components. If you require these to be separate then please use the releases from the [your_spotify repo](https://github.com/Yooooomi/your_spotify).
